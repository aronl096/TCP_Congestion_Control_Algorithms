# TCP_Congestion_Control_Algorithms

I wrote two program files: Sender.py and Receiver.py. 
The Sender will send a file and the Receiver will receive it and measure the time it took for his program to receive the file. 
The file will be sent in two parts (first half and second half [Each half should be 50% of the file]) each half will be sent according to one of the CC algorithms .
