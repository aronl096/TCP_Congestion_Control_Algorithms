# TCP_Congestion_Control_Algorithms

I wrote two program files: Sender.py and Receiver.py. <br>
The Sender will send a file and the Receiver will receive it and measure the time it took for his program to receive the file. <br>
The file will be sent in two parts (first half and second half [Each half should be 50% of the file]) each half will be sent according to one of the CC algorithms .<br>
